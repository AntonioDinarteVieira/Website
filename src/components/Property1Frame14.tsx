          As a marketer and consumer, one of the most important things to me is
          sustainability and ethical practices when it comes to my purchasing
          decisions. As an individual, I know I’m not the only one. Consumers in
          2023 and 2024 are interested in brands and their commitment to
          environmental and social responsibility. This shift is actually driven
          by global challenges like climate change and social inequality. This
          has resulted in an emphasis on sustainable and ethical marketing
          practices.

          If you scroll through some websites going into 2024, you will notice
          that brands are now taking the time to highlight their initiatives,
          like eco-friendly packaging and ethical sourcing. This makes marketing
          in 2024 as much about brand values as the products themselves.

          My advice as an experienced marketer who works with sustainable and
          ethical brands is that if you haven’t already, you need to figure out
          your brand values. Take the time to see how your brand is different;
          how are you putting in the effort to be a more ethical and sustainable
          brand? And, of course, while establishing these values, be sure to
          take the time to ensure they align with your overall brand strategy.
          The last thing you want to do is confuse your audience and surprise
          them with messaging that does not align with your overall strategy.
