          <p className={styles.thisFirstTactic}>
            This first tactic is a no-brainer: more short-form video content. As
            digital marketing experts, we watched this opportunity grow
            tremendously in 2023, and it’s going to be even bigger in 2024. All
            this is thanks to the popularity of platforms like TikTok, Instagram
            Reels and YouTube shorts.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.thisFirstTactic}>&nbsp;</p>
          <p className={styles.thisFirstTactic}>
            The excitement and engagement of short-form video content are
            becoming more and more appealing to audiences. Why? Because of
            shorter attention spans. Individuals like getting to the point
            quickly and don’t have the patience to wait for an answer.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.thisFirstTactic}>&nbsp;</p>
          <p className={styles.thisFirstTactic}>
            In 2024, we will see a lot of brands using short-form video concepts
            for multiple purposes, including advertising, social media,
            storytelling and more. In addition to this, expect to see more
            phone-shot content. Content shot with a phone comes off as more
            authentic than content shot with a professional video camera in
            social media and, now, even social media advertising. Viewers
            connect more to authentic content, as it is seen as relatable. Be
            sure to keep this in mind, depending on your industry, especially if
            you are selling B2C.
