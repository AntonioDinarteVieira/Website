          In 2023, we all watched as ChatGPT took over the world. People were
          using it everywhere! That said, artificial intelligence is not going
          anywhere; in fact, we’re about to see more of it in 2024. Entering
          2024, customer interactions are shifting significantly due to
          conversational marketing. This essentially means consumers expect
          instant responses, which they are receiving in the modern world. They
          want an answer and fast. And as brands, we must deliver.

          AI-powered tools like chatbots and virtual assistants are becoming
          significant as these tools facilitate real-time engagements, which
          offer prompt replies while assisting in decision-making processes.
          Now, this tool isn’t excellent for customer experience, but it also
          boosts conversion rates as it helps make that converting decision.
          We’ve been using this tactic for clients over the years, but even more
          so going into 2024, and I’ll tell you with complete honesty — it
          works. Depending on your business type and the services or products
          you offer, this can be an excellent tactic to try going into the new
          year.
