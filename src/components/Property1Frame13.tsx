          As crazy as this may sound, the differences between the digital and
          physical worlds are blurring due to virtual reality (VR) and augmented
          reality (AR). These technologies provide marketers with innovative
          opportunities to create engaging and immersive brand experiences. The
          applications are expanding from virtual showrooms to AR applications
          for home decor.

          For example, if you are interested in seeing a real estate listing,
          you do not actually have to drive there right away to see it. Many
          agents are now using virtual walkthrough videos to help attract
          audiences, which is amazing and saves time. If I want to see a preview
          of a home and determine if it is the right one for me, I’m going to
          check that virtual tour first, then make my next move from there. It’s
          great from a user-experience perspective! As VR and AR devices become
          more widely available, expect to see their increased incorporation
          into marketing strategies in 2024.
