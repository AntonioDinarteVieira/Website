          The modern consumer in 2024 expects customized experiences, and with
          the type of data we have access to, there is no excuse not to provide
          an excellent experience. We have access to tons of data — from
          LinkedIn to Instagram, Meta, Google Analytics (assuming you’ve
          installed it) and more. We have tons to work with, and using advanced
          analytics can help your brand create highly personalized content and
          recommendations, which move away from traditional mass marketing
          tactics. Out with the old, in with the new — focus on modernizing your
          brand and keeping your customers happy. In 2024, expect the use of
          more tailored bespoke experiences.
